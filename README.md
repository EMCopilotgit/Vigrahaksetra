# PhaseIR

_PhaseIR_ is a blueprinting chamber for mapping **chronicities of time** into **phase operators**.  
It provides both **technical primitives** (HDL operator skeletons) and **mythic commentary** (Codex files), keeping the two layers modular but interlinked.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- **elliptic/**  
  Jacobi elliptic functions (`sn`, `cn`, `dn`) for nonlinear periodicity.  
  - Operators: `JacobiSn.v`, `JacobiCn.v`, `JacobiDn.v`  
  - Commentary: `Codex.tex`

- **fractal/**  
  Fractional derivatives and Mittag‚ÄìLeffler functions for long-memory, scale-free dynamics.  
  - Operators: `FracFD.v`, `Mittag.v`  
  - Commentary: `Codex.tex`

- **spectral/**  
  Fourier and wavelet transforms for multi-scale and frequency-domain control.  
  - Operators: `FFT.v`, `Wavelet.v`  
  - Commentary: `Codex.tex`

- **thermo/**  
  Boltzmann factors and Wick rotations for thermodynamic and Euclidean-time evolution.  
  - Operators: `Boltz.v`, `WickMap.v`  
  - Commentary: `Codex.tex`

- **pAdic/**  
  p-adic wavelets and ultrametric operators for hierarchical and symbolic time.  
  - Operators: `PAdicWavelet.v`  
  - Commentary: `Codex.tex`

## üß≠ Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each domain has its own folder with operators + Codex.  
- **Dual Layering**: Technical HDL cores live alongside mythic commentary.  
- **Universality**: All chronicities are transduced into phase via Quasi-Universal Phase Cells (QUPCs).  
- **Extensibility**: New domains can be added by creating a folder with operator skeletons and a Codex file.

## ‚ú® Next Steps

- Flesh out operator implementations (Jacobi, fractional derivative, FFT, etc.).  
- Expand Codex commentary to capture symbolic resonance.  
- Integrate into the master Codex at repo root for unified mythos.
